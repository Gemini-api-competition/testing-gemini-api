### Explanation of Added Sections

- **Clone the repository**:Clone the repository: This command retrieves the project code from GitHub. You'll need Git installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official Git website (https://www.git-scm.com/downloads(https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
- **Install dependencies**: This command (npm install) uses the Node Package Manager (npm) to install all the necessary libraries required by the project. These libraries are specified in a file called package.json
- **Usage**: Detailed steps for starting the server and using the client-side application.

- **Security Considerations**: Do not share your API key publicly. It should be treated like a secret password and not be included in your code repository or embedded in the client-side application.


This `README.md` should provide clear instructions for setting up and using your project, as well as guidelines for contributing.
